## 🎤 Speaking Tips

### Tone:

### Pace:
- **Slower than normal conversation** (viewers need time to process)
- **Pause after each step** (2 seconds)
- **Emphasize key words** ("PIN", "QR Code", "Location")

### Language:
- **Mix Hindi & English** (comfortable for Indian audience)
  - "Namaste! Aaj hum dekhenge..."
  - Or stick to simple English (your choice!)
- **Avoid jargon** (say "PIN code" not "authentication token")
- **Short sentences** (easier to follow)

### Examples of Good Phrasing:
❌ BAD: "Navigate to the employees module and initiate the employee registration workflow"
