AI Voice Script (Natural Reading)

===== SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION (15 seconds) =====

Welcome to BizBooks, a simple attendance and inventory management system for small businesses.

In just three minutes, I'll show you how to create your account, add employees, and start tracking attendance with QR codes.

Let's get started!

===== SECTION 2: ACCOUNT CREATION (30 seconds) =====

Step one. Create your account.

Go to bizbooks dot co dot in and click Register.

Enter your business name. I'll use Demo Store.

Choose your subdomain. This will be your unique URL. I'll use demostore.

Add your company email and create a password.

Click Create My Account.

And you're in! That's it. Your business is now online.

===== SECTION 3: SITE LOCATION SETUP (30 seconds) =====

Step two. Setup your site location.

Click on Sites to add your business location.

Notice it shows zero, zero coordinates? We need to fix this.

Click the Edit button, the pencil icon.

Now go to Google Maps, find your office location, right-click and copy the coordinates.

Paste the latitude and longitude here.

Set the allowed radius. This is how far employees can be from your office to mark attendance. One hundred meters is good.

Save! Your site is ready.

===== SECTION 4: ADD EMPLOYEES (35 seconds) =====

Step three. Add your employees.

Click Employees, then scroll to Add New Employee.

Enter the name. Let's say Rahul Kumar.

Give him a simple PIN like one, two, three, four. He'll use this to mark attendance.

Add phone number and email.

Select his department and position.

You can also upload a photo or document like Aadhar card, but I'll skip that for now.

Save!

Let's add one more quickly. Priya Sharma, PIN five, six, seven, eight.

Done! We have two employees ready.

===== SECTION 5: QR CODE GENERATION (30 seconds) =====

Step four. Generate QR Code for attendance.

Click on QR Code Generator.

See this QR code? This is the magic!

Print this poster and stick it at your office entrance.

When employees come to work, they simply scan this QR code with their phone, enter their PIN, allow location permission, and click Check-In.

That's it! Attendance is marked automatically with photo, location, and timestamp.

When they leave, same process, but click Check-Out.

All attendance records appear here in the dashboard with photos, time, and distance from office.

===== SECTION 6: BONUS FEATURES (30 seconds) =====

You also get Inventory Management to track stock in and out across multiple sites.
